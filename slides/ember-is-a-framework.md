DOM Management

1. coupled dom click a button and another piece of the dom changes
2. Server rendered then another technology takes over to handle any updates.
3. The DOM could have the same data in many places.
    You update in one place you need to manage updating all the other places or not.
    ie: github.com issues
    ie: urbanspoon.com

back the DOM with a model
Update the data in the model and let the model dictate the dom representation.

beware of side effects.

layout thrashing
  imagine having a list of contacts with the count of all the contacts 17 then you say your model delete the contacts you want the model to delete contacts them recalculate the number of contacts.

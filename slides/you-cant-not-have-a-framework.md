##  You can't not have a framework

__Module__ - A unit that performs a single task or a few related tasks.

__Library__ - A set of modules with shared purpose.

__Framework__ - The glue between modules and libraries to expose a unified API with abstractions that keep code you don't want (or know) to write out of your application.
